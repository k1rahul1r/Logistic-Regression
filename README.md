The goal of this project is to implement classification using machine learning for a two-class problem and predict weather the patient has diabetes or not. In the first part of this project, I have implemented feature extraction, data processing and trained the model using gradient descent and calculated the accuracy using Logistic Regression. While in the second part, I have implemented neural networks with L1 and L2 as regularization methods. Finally, in the third part, I build neural network with dropout and L2 regularization methods and compared both.
